# 🚀 EASY GITHUB DEPLOYMENT (No Installation Needed)

Since Git is not installed on your computer, follow these 3 steps to publish your site manually!

## STEP 1: CREATE A REPO
1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. Repository name: `mahi-proposal`
3. Make it **Public**.
4. Click **Create repository**.
5. Look for the link: **"uploading an existing file"** (Click it!).

## STEP 2: DRAG & DROP
1. I have opened a folder named **`dist`** on your screen.
2. Drag **Everything Inside** that folder into the GitHub upload box.
3. Wait for the upload to finish.
4. Click **Commit changes** (Green Button).

## STEP 3: TURN IT ON
1. Go to **Settings** (Top right in your repo).
2. Click **Pages** (Left menu, near the bottom).
3. Under **Branch**, select **`main`** and click **Save**.
4. Wait 1 minute. Refresh the page.
5. You will see your live link at the top! (e.g. `yourname.github.io/mahi-proposal/`)

Send that link to Mahi! ❤️💍
